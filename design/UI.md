# HUD
1) Hotbar: Quick-use items from the player's inventory
2) Map: A view of the world around the player's location.
3) Debug: A floating window with some debugging info for me.  
4) Movement mode: An indicator of the player's current camera controller (Walking, flying, etc.)

## Hotbar
The hotbar holds up to 10 items from the player's inventory for quick-use.  
It's a view on "favourited" items, rather than a separate inventory space.  
It can be configured from the inventory screen.  
Different slots can be selected by scrolling on the scrollbar or hitting the numbers on the keyboard.
