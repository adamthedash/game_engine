# Dev Log

## Day 1
Today's goal was to learn the basics of windowing & rendering in rust.  
I'm following along with the [Learn WGPU](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/) and [Winit](https://docs.rs/winit/latest/winit/) tutorials.  

For my blocks, I'm rendering each face individually. Each face consists of 4 vertices in unit space, which are mapped to quick texture that I created in GIMP.  
To create a block, I'm creating 6 different instances of a face, which just transforms the face from unit-space into world space with a translation and rotation.  
So to create a simple 8x8x8 cube of blocks (which was about the limit where performance started to degrade), It's a total of 3072 faces being rendered.  

The render pipeline is pretty close to the Learn WGPU tutorial. It consists of:  
1) A handle to my GPU (or integrated graphics in the case of my laptop).  
2) A Winit window and drawable surface on it.  
3) A queue which is like a pipe to send commands to the GPU.  
4) A command encoder which translates the cross-platform commands into hardware-specific commands to be sent down the queue.  
5) A WGSL shader which runs on the GPU to do the drawing.  
6) Bind groups which allow you to group resources and swap them out easily during the rendering pass. The "layout" tells the shader code how the data buffers are interpreted, while the bind group itself links in the actual data buffers.  
7) A render pipeline, which is basically a combination of all of the above. You'd usually have one pipeline for each type of rendering you want to do. In my case a renderable in-world object.  

For the texture rendering, I've also got a depth buffer, which makes sure that objects are rendered in the right order. I don't think this prevents the GPU from actually doing the rendering, only that pixels are rendered in the right order, so it doesn't help much with performance.  

Since this is just a simple rendering MVP, I'm loading all of the data buffers onto the GPU up-front. In a real game I'll want to do this dynamically as the player moves around / interacts with the world.  
During the rendering pass which happens every frame, I first do some setup. 
1) I tell my encoder to start a new render pass, clearing the old screen and setting it to grey (my skybox colour). I also clear my depth buffer.  
2) I load up the render pipeline and bind groups for my textures and camera (will discuss camera later).  
3) I load up my data buffers. They're already on the GPU, they just need to be set as active.  
4) I send a draw command. This basically just executes the shader code on the loaded data.  

I also have some debug text that I want to draw on screen. Since I'm not using any sort of UI library, I'm just using [wgpu-text](https://github.com/Blatko1/wgpu-text).  
For now I'm just showing the camera variables, since it was a bit tricky to get the camera controller code right without visual feedback.  
The text render pass is a lot simpler, I just begin a new render pass, this time without clearing the screen, and the text.  

All of this so far has just been preparing actions for the GPU to do, it hasn't actually ran them. The last thing to do is to execute them by sending them to the queue.  
Side note: Interacting with a GPU is usually an async thing. The only async needed was to create the initial device handle, so I'm assuming that everything else is a blocking API abstracted away by WGPU. I'm using [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) which is probably overkill, but I'm familiar with it and it might come back into play later when I want to do something like async world loading.  

Moving onto the camera then, I'm just doing a basic one that looks at the world origin and rotates around it, similar to say a 3D modelling tool.  
The state and behaviour of the camera are split out into a Camera (state) and CameraController (behaviour). This will let me swap them out easily for different types of movement, eg. walking around vs flying.  
During the rendering, the camera is turned into a [View-Projection Matrix](https://jsantell.com/model-view-projection/), which basically encodes all the transformations needed (translation, rotation, perspective) to go from world-space to camera-space into a single matrix. The cool thing about this is that you can [compose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_matrix#Composing_and_inverting_transformations) a complex chain of transformations into a single matrix up-front, then applying them to each object is constant time.  
The camera matrix is passed to the shader during the rendering pass to put objects in the right spot.  

For the camera controller, I'm using an extremely simple one. It uses WASD, space, Z to go in/out/up/down/left/right. Winit events are intercepted and passed to the controller if they're keyboard inputs.  

All in all pretty happy with day 1's progress. Got the basics of rendering and event handling sorted. Here's what the final result looks like:
